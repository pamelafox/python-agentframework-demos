"""Writer → Reviewer workflow with conditional edges based on a sentinel token.

Demonstrates: conditional edges, condition functions that inspect
AgentExecutorResponse, and a terminal @executor node.

The Reviewer is instructed to begin its response with exactly "APPROVED"
or "REVISION NEEDED". Two outgoing edges route the flow accordingly:
    - APPROVED        → publisher (terminal @executor)
    - REVISION NEEDED → editor (terminal Agent)

This is the minimal branching version focused only on conditional edges.
For a more robust pattern that uses workflow state and iterative revisions,
see workflow_conditional_state.py.

Run:
    uv run examples/workflow_conditional.py  (opens DevUI at http://localhost:8094)
